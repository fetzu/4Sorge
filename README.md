## Advanced Features

### Coordination Fee
The coordination fee is deducted from your yearly salary before calculating contributions. This is a standard practice in Swiss pension systems to account for the portion of salary already covered by the first pillar (AHV/AVS). You can:
- Set multiple coordination fee values for different years
- The app will automatically apply the correct fee based on the simulation year

### Degree of Occupation
Your degree of occupation (part-time percentage) affects your insurable salary. You can:
- Set different occupation levels for different years
- Model career changes from part-time to full-time (or vice versa)
- Contributions are calculated based on your actual working percentage

### Insurable Salary
The insurable salary is calculated as: `Yearly Salary + Bonus - Coordination Fee`, adjusted by your degree of occupation. This is the amount on which your pension contributions are calculated.
