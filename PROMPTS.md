# Prompts to Claude 3.7 Sonnet used to make this app

## Prompt 1
I need you to write a Python app following the following requirements:
* The app should be a single python file, additional files (for example an HTML template) are OK.
* The app should have a GUI (either a web interface or a TUI).
* The app should use a simple human readable (for example TOML or JSON) to store its data, the file should be located in the same folder as where the script is ran.
* The app should not create files elsewhere on the system.
* The app is a pension fund simulator/calculator called "4Sorge". It should do the following:
   * With data provided by the user (date of birth, age of retirement, current salary, maximum salary, estimated time to maximum salary, expected pension annual yield, and monthly pension information) it should allow to generate both a tabular and graphic projection of the total sum for pension).
   * The pension information should be configurable with the following:
      * The user should be able to set their "own" contributions (in percentage of salary) and their employers contribution.
      * The contributions should be configurable over time through ranges with changing contributions (for example, the employer contribution could be 6% between the ages of 18 to 25, 9% between 25 and 35, 14% between 35 and 45, and so on...).
      * There should be an option to set 3 different "own" contribution values in order to compare the impact on the total sum (the user could for example have their own contribution be either 6%, 7% or 9%).
      * There should be a way to setup multiple pension plans (duplicating an existing one or creating it from scratch) and compare them.
      * There should be a way for the user to enter the current total value of their pension fund (at a certain date) and simulate the data from there on.
   * The goal of the app is to provide the user with a way to
      1. Simulate their current pension fund value until their retirement. That means give the total expected value of the fund at the age or retirement and a graphical representation of its total value over time.
      2. Simulate the impact of choosing one of the 3 "own contribution" alternatives over total value and time.
      3. Compare multiple pension plans.

Give me the code using best state-of-the-art programming practices and commenting where necessary. Also provide a README.md file with features, and installation and usage instructions.

## Prompt 2
This is great.

Now I want you to add the following features to the app:
* The tabular "Detailed Projection" should be toggleable between yearly (as now) and monthly.
* There should be a flag for a 13th salary (in which case the yearly salary is divided into equal 13 months instead of 12) and a yearly bonus (settable as either a percentage of the yearly salary or just a user provided value).
* In addition to english, the app should also be available in German (Switzerland), French (Switzerland) and Italian (Switzerland). The language should be changeable through the web interface and saved in the config file.
* There should be a way to "export" the results as a PDF. Using the web browser's print option is acceptable, but the output should have a nice(r) format.

Implement those changes and return the code.

## Prompt 3
I am getting the following error when using the app (appears both in the console and the app's main web page): (paste of error message)

## Prompt 4
It is now working properly, thank you.

I need you to add the following features:
* The "own contributions" should also be configurable over time through ranges with changing contributions (for example, the employer contribution could be 6% between the ages of 18 to 25, 9% between 25 and 35, 14% between 35 and 45, and so on...). The difference with the employer contribution is that each range should have 3 different user settable percentages.
* In addition to the age, the graphics should also show the year when hovering.

## Prompt 5 (New chat, py and README provided)
I need you to introduce the following feature to this app:
* The app should take into acount a yearly "coordination fee" which is deducted from the yearly salary. It means that the amount for the own and employer contributions correspond to: "yearly salary + bonus - coordination fee".
   * This coordination fee should be user configurable, and can change over time. Introduce another setting in which the user can set the coordination fee "from" year. The user should be able to set multiple "from year coordination fee values" (for example, the coordination fee could be 20000 from 2000, and change to 22000 starting in 2010) and the simulation should take them into account properly. The coordination value is called "Koordinationsbetrag" in German, "montant de coordination" in French and "trattenuta di coordinamento" in Italian.
* The user should be able to set their degree of occupation. This is in percent, the salary always being equal to that of 100% occupation. It should be possible to have the degree of occupation change overtime (with a yearly granularity). Implement those changes and return the code for the app as well as an updated README. The README should not speak of these changes as changes but rather describe the app in its current state.
* The user should be able to input a precise date (month and year) and get the total value of their pension at that point in time according to the simulation.
* The print/export to PDF option is not currently working. Nothing happens when the user presses the button. Fix this.

Return the whole modified code as well as the README.md.I need you to introduce the following feature to this app:

## Prompt 6
Thank you, it is working now.

The "Print/Export to PDF" does not seem to be working. Pressing it created another button beneath it, but it does not do anything. Could you make it so that using the browser's print function OR the streamlit print function returns a nicely formatted printout? Currently the printout has huge empty headers.

## Prompt 7
It looks better.
* But the button "Print/Export to PDF" is still shown on the web interface and returns an error, what do I have to remove to make it disappear? Are there any other changes I should make?
* Is there a way to make the tables look better on the printout? Currently the tables are randomly split across pages. Is there a way to make sure they fit on a single page, or to repeat the headers if they are to span across multiple pages?

## Prompt 8
The app is still showing titles for things which are not "usable" and should not be part of the PDF such as:
"Pension Calculator
Personal Information
Salary Information
Bonus Settings
Simulation Results
Check Fund Value at Specific Date"

Can you make sure the print only starts at the Final Pension Values at Retirement section? Can you also make it so that the print returns the three options (instead of just the currently selected one) on the output?

## Prompt 9 (New chat)
Here is a Python app. It has the following issues:
1. When viewing on the web, all "options" are displayed consecutively at the end of the page. This should not happen, only the currently selected option should be shown. When printing, all options should be printed.
2. The print has unnecessary elements such as "Pension Calculator
Personal Information
Salary Information
Bonus Settings
Simulation Results"
Make sure that only Final Pension Values at Retirement, Pension Fund Growth Comparison, and Detailed Projection for all options are printed.

## Prompt 10
If I deploy the app to streamlit (online), where would the data be stored?

## Prompt 11
Yes, modify the app with the option you suggested. Make sure no data is ever stored outside of the user's machine.

## Prompt 12
I have the following python app.

The "import" of data does not seem to work properly: the app goes into an infinite refresh loop.

I need you to help me troubleshoot the issue. Before making any code changes, what can I do to provide you with better logs/information?

## Prompt 13 (new chat; also ran through Gemini 2.5 Pro)
Can you analyse the following python app and make sure that indeed no data will leave the user's device EVEN IF it was deployed through the Streamlit Community Cloud?

## Prompt 14
I have provided you with a python app.

It is still displaying some strange behavior with the "printing", I need you to correct the following issues:
* Make sure the whole "Pension Calculator" section is not printed.
* Make sure the "Check Fund Value at Specific Date" is not printed.
* Make sure  the three "Detailed Projection for Option x" (1 to 3) are all printed out IN ORDER (1 to 3) regardless of the currently selected option for detail view by the user.
* Make sure that the tables do not show up with opacity (example of "Annual Contributions - Option 1" in the second PDF provided) when printing.
* The web view should only display the currently selected "Detailed Projection for Option" and NOT all of them.

Return only changed parts of the code with instruction on which line to insert them to.

## Prompt 15
Provided is a python app.

I need to you correct and implement the following changes:

Currently, selecting an option for the "Select an option to view details" just adds the projection graph underneath the previously selected option. Which means if the user selects Option 1, then Option 2, then Option 3, then Option one again, the page will display the graph for Options 1 to 3 with a little opacity and then the one for Option 1 again (with normal colors). Make it so that selecting a new option from "Select an option to view details"  clears the previously selected graph/element before displaying the selected one. NOTE: this also happens on the other pages, where the graphs always stay there, sometimes at the very top of the page.

Move the "Simulation Results" monthly/yearly "Toggle View" underneath the "Bonus Settings" section.

When using the monthly view, the "Detailed Projection" table should show the bonus month (after December at the end of the year) as "13th YYYY" (German: "13er YYYY", French "13e YYYY" and Italian "13a YYYY").

Return only changed parts of the code with instruction on which line to insert them to.

## Prompt 16
In the following python script, something is not working properly in the web interface: selecting an option for detailed view creates a chart which then won't go away and always show up with a bit of transparency on every page of the app (until the next refresh).

Suggest the code changes necessary to fix this issue.

Example of unwanted element's paths:
#root > div:nth-child(1) > div.withScreencast > div > div > div > section.main.st-emotion-cache-bm2z3a.ea3mdgi8 > div.block-container.st-emotion-cache-1jicfl2.ea3mdgi5 > div > div > div > div:nth-child(11)

#root > div:nth-child(1) > div.withScreencast > div > div > div > section.main.st-emotion-cache-bm2z3a.ea3mdgi8 > div.block-container.st-emotion-cache-1jicfl2.ea3mdgi5 > div > div > div > div.element-container.st-emotion-cache-7l5wbv.e1f1d6gn4
with an attribute class="element-container st-emotion-cache-7l5wbv e1f1d6gn4"
and some HTML

## Prompt 17
Provided is a python app. All the interactions are working properly, but the print view is returning some terribly formatted output.

Correct the app so that the print output is nicer. The following elements should be shown (in this order):
1. Simulation Results
   1. Final Pension Values at Retirement (table)
2. Pension Fund Growth Comparison
3. Detailed Projection for Option 1
4. Detailed Projection for Option 2
5. Detailed Projection for Option 3

You should also make sure that graphs are NEVER split between two pages, and ideally that tables are also not split between two pages (and if they are, because they are longer than a single page, the headers should repeat on the first line of the new page).

Return only the changed portions of code.

## Prompt 18
Here is a python app. I want you to focus on the print function and change the app in the following manner:

* Remove the "Print Report" button at the end of the page. All print should be done by the user using their web browser.
* Always display all three detailed options (and their respective charts) on the "Pension Calculator" page.
* Remove the "Select an option to view details" feature from the "Pension Calculator" page.
* Currently the navigation is not working, all pages lead to/display the "Pension Calculator" page. Fix this.
* Make the navigation the first item of the sidebar, before language selection.
* Make sure that printing the page with the browser gives a nicely formatted output:
   * Remove all the unnecessary titles and text from the output (for example "Pension Calculator", "Personal Information", "Salary Information", "Bonus Settings", "Contribution Options"...)
   * Make sure the "Final Pension Values at Retirement" table and "Pension Fund Growth Comparison" chart are displayed on the first page.
   * Pages 2 to 4 should display the "Detailed Projection for Option X", with Option 1 being on page 2, Option 2 on page 3, and Option 3 on page 4. Make sure each option nicely fits on one single page.

Return only the changed portions of code. Return whole functions and not parts.

## Prompt 19
The app is now severely broken. Here is the code in its current state. Let us simplify this:
* I want you to remove all formatting and javascript done for printing and keep the formatting to a bare minimum for the web app.
* The "Pension Calculator" page should always display the three detailed options (in order from 1 to 3)
* The "Employer Contributions", "Coordination Fee", "Degree of Occupation" should work again (currently blank)
* The other pages ("Plan Management" and "Comparison") should work again.

Return only the changed portions of code. Return whole functions and not parts.

## Prompt 20
Provided is a python app with streamlit.

I want you to make the print output (through the browser or system's "Print" menu, no need to add buttons to the interface) look a certain way.
1. It should contain ONLY the following sections:
   1. Final Pension Values at Retirement
   2. Pension Fund Growth Comparison (with chart)
   3. Detailed Projection for Option 1 (with table)
   4. Annual Contributions - Option 1 (graph)
   5. Detailed Projection for Option 2 (with table)
   6. Annual Contributions - Option 2 (graph)
   7. Detailed Projection for Option 3 (with table)
   8. Annual Contributions - Option 3 (graph)
2. Sections 1 and 2 shall be on page 1.
3. Sections 3 and 4 shall be on page 2.
4. Sections 5 and 6 shall be on page 3.
5. Sections 7 and 8 shall be on page 4.
6. The graphs and tables shall have margins on both the left and the right side of the page.
7. The tables shall be displayed in full. If they have to be split between multiple pages for length, make sure that the table headers are repeated on the top of each new page.

Do not change anything else. Return only the changed portions of code. Return whole functions and not parts.

# Prompt 21
The app is working (full code provided again with current state).

I need you to do the following:
* Move the "Print Report" section from the "Pension Calculator" page to the sidebar. It should be placed before data management.
* Make sure the texts for "Print Report" are translated and available in German, French and Italian as well.

Return only changed functions. You can return just the new translation keys to add to "TRANSLATIONS".

## Prompt 22 (new chat for "1Pillar" function)
I have provided you with the source code of a Python app. I need you to expand the app by adding a new feature called "1Pillar".
 Using the already provided data (from the "Pension Calculator" page) it should allow to generate both a tabular and graphic projection of the expected monthly annuity for the Swiss 1st Pillar. The Swiss 1st pillar is an obligatory insurance that starts being page at the age of retirement (65 years old), with an option to take it up to 5 years earlier or later. The amount of the monthly payments is based on how much was paid into the insurance, there is a minimum sum and an upper limit. In the end, the amount of the monthly allowance is determined according to the "revenu annuel moyen" (average yearly income) of the employee over their lifetime. The value of the "revenu annuel moyen" changes overtime, historical data will be provided bellow.
   * The 1st pillar information should be configurable with the following:
      * The user should be able to set their yearly income on a per-year granularity. You can work with ranges, and always assume the latest value in the range will be the yearly income until retirement. The user should also be able to input "projections" of expected revenue for future years.
      * There should be a way to set the "revenu annuel moyen" needed to reach 100% allowance (as well as the "minimum sum", which not reaching causes a "penalty year"). You shall pre-fill it with historical data, but the user should be able to make more entries. The employee should pay for 45 years to receive a full pension. The reduced pension is calculated as follows: "Reduced pension = Full pension × (Years contributed / Required contribution years".
      * There should be a way to set the current monthly payouts according to the "revenu annuel moyen". The data should be pre-filled and is provided below. The data should be modifiable by the user, who shall also be able to create new entries/ranges.
   * The software should recognize years where the revenue has been zero or less than the "minimum", and count these years as "penalty years". The number of penalty years shall be displayed clearly on the page.
   * The goal of the app is to provide the user with a way to
      1. Project that their monthly allowance will be at the age or retirement, in percent of the maximum allowance.
     2. Print the results in a nice format (you can do this using the same HTML download method as for the other page)
     3. Have a graphic representation of the minimum and maximum payout conditions compared to the user's (red being minimum, and green being the maximum). This should be a chart using amount over time.

## Prompt 23 (new chat)
I have provided you with a python app.

There are some issues I need you to fix:
* The computing of the early/late factor seem to be inverted: going to pension early increases the pension amount when it should actually decrease it. Details are below.
* When adding new entried to the "1st Pillar Projection" page, the newly added entry should use the previou's entry "To Year" + 1 year as its default "From Year". The last entry in the list should go from the "From Year" until the age of retirement automatically.

Do not change anything else. Return only the changed portions of code. Return whole functions and not parts.

DETAILS ABOUT EARLY/LATE FACOTORS:
(omitted)

## Prompt 24
I have provided you with a python app.

There are some issues I need you to fix:
* The Early/Late Retirement should be moved from the "1st Pillar Configuration" to the "1st Pillar Summary" tab.
* The computing of the early/late factor seem to be inverted: going to pension early increases the pension amount when it should actually decrease it. Make sure the Early/Late Retirement slider has the right effect on the pension.
* Uploading a data file does not automatically load it (the user has to change pages so that their data is shown). Make it so that uploading a data file will refresh the page with the correct data.

Do not change anything else. Return only the changed portions of code. Return whole functions and not parts.

## Prompt 25 (new chat)
I have provided you with a python app.

The app as an issue with the use of the "Early/Late Retirement" slider: using the sliders make the app a little wonky. It does not automatically refresh when the slider is used, but does this once the slider is used a second time... returning to the previously set value. Correct this.

Do not change anything else. Return only the changed portions of code. Return whole functions and not parts.

## Prompt 26
Is there a way to pre-compute the values instead and update the graphs and tables dynamically (without having to reload the page) when using the slider?

## Prompt 27 (new chat)
I have provided with a Python app and its README.

Rewrite the README.md with the following considerations:
* The document should be in 4 languages (English, German (Switzerland), French (Switzerland) and Italian (Switzerland)), in that order. There should be a header on top to link to an anchor point of each language.
* Keep the "TL;DR" section as is.
* Make sure the link to the online version (on streamlit) is mentioned once at the top (can be in English) and in each language section again.
* The features should be listed, but kept relatively simple.
* Do not create a separate "Advanced Features" section.
* Regroup "installation" and "usage" until one single section (with those two as sub-sections) called "Offline / Local use".
* Revamp to "Data Storage" section to reflect the current app's state. Make it a point to mention the app is designed not to leak any of your data, but in order to be 100% sure one should deploy and use locally. Using on streamlit depends on a third-party provided that I cannot make guarantees for.
* Do not have a "Features Breakdown" section.

Return a properly formatted MD file.

## Prompt 28
Here is the modified README.md file. Can you make sure that an informal tone is used in German, French and Italian ("Sie" = "du", "vous" = "toi"...). Return the whole README file.
